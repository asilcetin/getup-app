# GetUp App
Healthy Work Cycle Tracker - Mac/Win/Linux Desktop App

## Development
* Clone the repo to your local machine
* Make sure you have node.js and npm installed
* Move inside the directory: cd ../getup-app
* Install dependencies: npm install
* Make your changes to the .js/.html/.css files
* Consult electron documentation for platform specific methods
* Run app on your machine without packaging: npm start
* Package the app: npm run dist (currently the "build" definition in package.json is only for Mac. For Win/Lin definitions should be added there)
